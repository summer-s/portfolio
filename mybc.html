                    <p>MyBudgetCoach is a financial coaching platform that helps low- and moderate-income families improve their financial health. Coaches use MyBC to deliver financial education during sessions, and clients can access a suite of tools, tracking their financial wellness between sessions.</p>

            <h3>Tool Redesign</h3>
            <p>In an effort to modernize the look and feel of MyBC, our team was told to start with the three tools used by clients and coaches to track each client's financial wellness- MyExpenses, MyGoals, and MyBudget. During the intro sessions, coaches teach the clients how to use each tool, and encourage them to get in the habit of using them on their own.</p>
            <p>It was important that the new design was mobile-friendly, so that clients could do things like add expenses, track goals, and view their budgets on the go. We designed for smaller screens first, letting them be our base. Desktop versions came later, once we were sure the mobile view was good to go.</p>
            <h4>MyExpenses</h4>
            <p>MyExpenses, the MyBC expense tracker, had previously been table based and not responsive (screenshot below). This made it particularly hard (if not borderline impossible) for users to enter their expenses on the go.</p> <img src="images/work/mybc/expensebefore.jpg" alt="" class="underText">
            <p class="imgDesc">MyExpenses: Before</p>

            <p>We imagined scenarios that clients might find themselves in where they'd want to input their income and expenses without logging into a desktop computer. Perhaps after a grocery trip, a client could enter their total into MyExpenses while on a bus. Maybe a client could open a paycheck and input their income amount quickly before rushing off to pick up their kids from school. We needed to make this easier for them.</p>
