                <div>
                    <p>Communally, the antipoverty technology company, underwent a rebrand in the summer of 2017. Once the company name and logo were chosen, our team was tasked with creating a new website under a tight deadline.</p>
                </div>

            </div>
            <div class="buttonGroup"><a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/I2zjNwlQsTS3wtd6aXm5qr/communally.tech?scaling=scale-down&node-id=3%3A0" class="button">View Clickable Prototype</a></div>
            <h3>Website Redesign</h3>
            <p>Message Agency of Philadelphia designed our new logo and provided us with a fresh color palette. With a little over a month before the scheduled launch, I used the provided brand guidelines to create a few possible paths we could go down and presented them to the team.</p>

        <p class="imgDesc">The first (of many) attempts at nailing down a specific style</p>

        <p class="imgDesc">Exploring the direction I wanted to take the top half of the homepage</p>

        <p class="imgDesc">Behold, the chosen one</p>
        <div class="textWidth">
            <p>Our winner emerged. It was equally community and tech-focused, exactly what Communally needed. I chose to include a few company stats such as how many people we'd helped and where our partners are located, in order to build trust with potential partners and investors.</p>
            <p>I ran with the circuit board motif, using a simplified version for CTAs and headers around the site. Images of people representing communities we assisted are also featured prominently.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="textWidth">
            <img src="images/work/communally/communally6.png" alt="icons" class="soloImage noShadow">
            <p>I created a set of custom icons for this project. Most appear on the careers page, but you can see a few scattered throughout the rest of the site as well. If given the time, I always prefer to create my own icons, giving my projects a unique touch.</p>

        <div class="textWidth">
            <p>This project was a great opportunity to test my rapid prototyping skills, creating quite a few mockups/style boards quickly in order to test concepts and find ones that work.</p>
            <p>I used Figma, a collaborative design tool, to create all of the mockups for this project. It was my first time using Figma, but by the end of the project I was an advocate for the tool, leading the team to adopt it for subsequent interface design projects.</p>
