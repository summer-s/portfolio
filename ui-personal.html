                <h1>Personal Projects: UI</h1>
                <div><p>Sometimes I want to try ideas and techniques that I won't get a chance to implement on any current projects. That's where personal projects come in!</p></div>

            <h3>Daily UI Design Challenge</h3>
            <p>I decided to finally hop on the bandwagon and begin a daily UI design challenge. Each weekday, a short prompt is emailed to me, and I create a UI element or mockup. The challenge isn't perfect; you're not provided any information beyond which element you're to create. You don't get information about your users, brand, platform, or anything else that would be helpful to UX designers.
            <p>It can feel a little superficial, but I thought this would be a good way to try out new design tools, techniques, and styles I otherwise might not have been able to. I'll share my favorites here!</p>

            <h4>Day 001 - Sign Up</h4>
            <p>I created this logo the very first time I opened up Figma, and dug it out to use it for this chat app concept. Users would have 3 options when creating an account. If they don't want to connect a social media account, they could sign up with email.</p>
            <p>I included a password creation hint so that users wouldn't get frustrated typing in their ideal password only to be told that it's not long enough. It's better to be up front with users!</p>

        <div class="textWidth"><h4>Day 002 - Checkout</h4>
            <p>The prompt for day 2 was simply "credit card checkout". I decided to envision a subscription based online service aimed at professionals. After researching other subscription based online services and how they handle the checkout process, I created the checkout page for a fictional company.</p>

        <div class="textWidth"><h4>Day 003 - Landing Page</h4>
            <p>Day 3's prompt was "landing page (above the fold). I created a landing page for a local nature preserve after researching the sites of other nature preserves. Most emphasize a "donate" link, and have photos of wildlife found at the preserve.</p>
