            <h3>Application Process Paint Job</h3>
            <p>The outer shell of TBB had been made responsive, but now it was time to tackle the difficult part- the actual application process. Because of time restraints, we wouldn't be able to completely redesign the application, but we could spruce it up a bit and make it slightly less painful to use on smaller screen sizes. The project was affectionately deemed "the paint job".</p>

            <h4>The Challenge</h4>
            <p>Most of the application system was built using HTML tables, before all of the modern CSS layout options were widely adopted. We wouldn't be able to go in and rip the tables out at the time, because of the complicated templating system in place. Save for a few select modules that were used almost unchanged throughout most of TBB's application processes, we had to keep essentially the same layout for most pages, but we could tweak things like colors, font styles, etc.</p>
            <p>We also wouldn't be able to take a look at each of the hundreds of pages separately. Instead, we just payed special attention to each type of page element (headers, question groups, etc) and did our best to make nice looking lego blocks that would fit together beautifully in the end.</p>

            <h4>Before</h4>
            <p>Looking at what was the current application system, I was particularily concerned with the confusing visual heirarchy and spacing users had to grapple with. TBB's goal is to make filing for benefits simple and easy, and while the system offers hints and help to guide the user through the process, the design of many of the pages threatented to counteract that.</p>

            <p class="imgDesc">An example of the table-based layout affecting readability</p>
            <p>I knew I wanted to tighten up the visual heirarchy and to make the design more consistent with the rest of TBB. Using some patterns established from earlier TBB responsive projects, I got to work.</p>

            <h4>The Solution</h4>
            <p>First, I went through the an application myself and took note of all of the different elements I could find. I created mockups showing how the elements would come together to create full pages.</p>
        </div>
        <img src="images/work/tbb/tbb1.jpg" alt="" class="soloImage">
        <p class="imgDesc">The TBB paint job at a glance</p>
        <div class="textWidth">
            <p>As mentioned, for most of the application pages, we couldn't change the layout. For pages like that, I created two mockups, which together covered most of the elements users would come across while filling out their application. These two mockups served as the paint job's foundation.</p>
