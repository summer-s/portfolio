            <h1>Communally</h1>
            <div>
                <p>Communally, the antipoverty technology company, underwent a rebrand in the summer of 2017. Once the company name and logo were chosen, our team was tasked with creating a new website under a tight deadline.</p>

                    <li>Year: 2017</li>

        <h3>Website Redesign</h3>
        <p>With only about a month provided before the scheduled launch, we got to work. It wouldn't be easy, but who doesn't love a good rebrand to invigorate the office?</p>
        <p>Message Agency of Philadelphia designed our new logo and provided us with a fresh color palette. I used the brand guidelines to create a few possible paths we could go down and presented them to the team.</p>
        <p>We had a winner. It was equally humanitarian and tech-focused, exactly what Communally needed. I chose to include a few of our brand stats such as how many people we've helped and where our sites are located, in order to build trust with potential partners.</p>
